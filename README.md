# Hi, I'm Sipho Nkebe 👋

Full-Stack Developer | Cape Town, South Africa 🇿🇦

I build modern, scalable web applications with a focus on clean code and exceptional user experiences. With expertise spanning frontend frameworks, backend architecture, and database design, I thrive on solving complex problems and bringing ideas to life.

## What I Do

I specialize in full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript development, building everything from dynamic React frontends to robust Node.js backends. Whether it's crafting pixel-perfect interfaces with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, architecting RESTful and GraphQL APIs, or integrating headless CMS solutions, I approach each project with attention to detail and a commitment to quality.

I'm comfortable working with modern frameworks like Next.js and TanStack Start, managing databases with MySQL and PostgreSQL, and deploying applications on Cloudflare's edge network. I also bring experience with Python, WordPress development, and design tools like Figma and Canva to round out my skill set.

AI tools have become a valuable part of my development workflow, helping me move faster without compromising on fundamentals. I use them strategically to enhance productivity while maintaining strong problem-solving skills and code quality.
